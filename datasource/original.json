All their preparation paid off as they successfully reached the summit of Everest. This was the birth of Craghoppers.\nIt's our passion and our experience of travel that inspires us to experiment further and further with our ranges of essential clothing. And let me tell you, it's a never-ending cycle because the minute we see our fresh designs in fabric, we just want to get them out there and prove what they can do. This momentum is the essence of our brand and it's what keeps us keen, keeps you ready for anything and brings the rest of the world closer to your comfort zone.\n"

Natural functionality combined with technical treatments allow you to feel your best when wearing each piece.\nOUR PRODUCTSDavid Gandy Wellwear takes a multi-sensory approach to design, evoking a sense of wellbeing through exceptional comfort, fit and fabrication. With studies showing that simply touching smooth fabrics can create a sense of psychological wellbeing and reduce negative emotions, Wellwear’s use of tactile fabrics is key.\nFabrics selected fuse natural functionality and science. The best natural fibres, including Pima cotton, lyocell and modal, guarantee ultimate softness when connecting with the skin and natural properties such as body temperature regulation and moisture wicking create an additional layer of comfort. Wellwear also pushes the boundaries of accessible fabric innovation by applying technical treatments to garments to physically enhance the wearer’s wellbeing. These include anti-odour and anti-bacterial properties which reduce the need to wash clothes after every wear, increasing longevity of the garment and in turn having a positive wider environmental impact. The use of aloe vera plant extracts in garments provides wound healing, anti-inflammatory and moisturising properties.\n"

This philosophy and disruptive innovation have carried the brand from Scottish local hero to global market leader.\nEndura has been selected consistently as clothing partner by the world’s top teams and riders on road, mtb and triathlon. Their collaboration with leading experts in other fields such as aerodynamics and bike fitting ensure the product is constantly on the cutting edge. On road, a close partnership with Movistar Team, the UCI Number 1 ranked World Tour team again for 2016, has driven a new level of R & D and production methods. This has resulted in incredible performances in race and on track. At Endura we never take the easy route – never complacent, we are always thinking about the next part of the journey.\n"

We believed that Glasgow lacked a store that sold all the basic ingredients of street culture, such as clothing, footwear and design led books. Brands such as Urban Kubrick and Bearbrick toys as well as Spray Paint and Spray Paint Supplies were also in short supply, so Fat Buddha was born and has been kicking up a storm ever since. After many customer requests, we launched our website to cater for our customers from all over the world.

As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.\n"

    "description": "Our founders, Jeff and Andy, created Harry’s in 2013 because they were tired of overpaying for over-designed razors. Instead, they wanted simple, high-quality products that felt good to use, all at a fair price. Here’s five reasons why we’ve been tried by over 20 million customers worldwide. \nWe focus on quality: razor blades are knives that you take to your face, so they better be good. Our German factory ensures we produce quality razor blades, every time. We strive to produce the highest quality products for our customers, focusing on simple, clean design and the features that matter most for a comfortable shave: 5 blades, flex hinge, lubrication strip, precision trimmer blade, and a weighted ergonomic handle.\nWe want to always provide honest value: which is why we sell our razor blades from just £1.75 each - by owning our factory, we cut out the middle man so we can offer high-quality products at a fair price.\nWe made it easy to try us: our Trial Set includes a 5-blade razor (colour of your choice), shave gel and a travel cover for just £3.95 when you sign up to a subscription. \nWe do good for customers and the community: every year, we set aside 1% of our sales to support nonprofits providing mental health care services to men in need.\nWe’re not just a shaving company: we’re focused on making your grooming routine better in more ways than one. Our product range has expanded and we are quickly becoming famous for a host of other award-winning products including Shave Gel, Post-Shave Balm, Skin Care and Shower Gel.\n"

    "description": "For almost one hundred years Humbrol has been producing superior quality paints.  During that time Humbrol has become perhaps the best-known name in the modelling field and has established a world-wide reputation for excellence.  Founded in 1919 as the Humber Oil Company, Humbrol initially supplied bicycle oil for Hull's growing army of cyclists.  In 1935, however, the company was asked to produce paints for renovating cycles, and came up with Art Enamel.  At first only black was available, but demand for other colours rapidly followed, and two years later a range of twelve colours was launched. These came in 'tinlets' sufficient to repaint a complete cycle frame and mudguards - and all for just sixpence!  That emphasis on value was to become a central feature of HumbrolтАЩs operations, and remains so to this day.\nThe increasing popularity of DIY provided a further challenge, and in 1965 Humbrol launched a range of paints and adhesives created specifically for this market.  These were followed, in the seventies, by the introduction of artistтАЩs brushes, and modelling craft tools.  Additionally, the number of shades in the standard colour range tinlets rose to 80, and has subsequently risen to its present total of 171.\n"

In 1987, three friends in the fashion capital of the world (Antwerp rules!) decided that women needed high-quality bags that were iconic and chic and feminine and fashionable and... not boring! So they created a line of casual and colourful bags that were affordable, sporty and functional, packed with attitude but never serious or stuffy or stuck-up. In a word... FUN! They named the brand Kipling, after the well-known and well-travelled author Rudyard Kipling. Soon, their bags were part of the everyday adventures of women around the world. Today, Kipling mascot monkeys, by far the world’s best-travelled primates, dangle from a full range of handbags, luggage and carry-alls. Trendy yet practical, upscale yet reasonably priced, durable yet daring, Kipling bags are the must-have accessories of over 35 million women in more than 60 countries.\n"

    "description": "La Coqueta is a luxury children’s clothing brand, established in 2013 by mother of five, Celia Muñoz. Known for refined silhouettes and distinctive style that amplifies everyday aesthetics, every collection marries modern traditionalism with nostalgia. Famously known as Celia’s “sixth child”, La Coqueta grows each season, maintaining a truly global sentiment that strives to represent the diversity and inclusion of our community.\nThe translation of ‘La Coqueta’ to English is well-groomed, relating to the Spanish culture of self-care and dress. The definition connects to every aspect of the La Coqueta experience, from the finish of clothing and hand-crafted accessories to the in-store experiences and careful packing of our orders.\nDesigned to be treasured and passed down to the next generation, each La Coqueta collection invites you to be swept away by the escapism of nostalgia. Centring on an aesthetic that roots itself in the past yet simultaneously celebrates the present, the latest range maintains the tradition of hand-making clothing and an arts-and-crafts nature, with distinctive floral prints and hand-smocked characteristics. Lose yourself in the art of dress with pure cotton silhouettes, luxuriously soft linen, and buttery soft Nappa leather, shown through elegant yet down-to-earth styles with a signature sentimental flair.\n"

Inspired by the oceanic world, Huber fermented nutrient rich sea kelp with other natural ingredients. After 12 years and 6,000 experiments of meticulous craftsmanship, the precious, nutrient-rich Miracle Broth™ was born —and Huber’s skin visibly restored. The Miracle Broth™ is at the heart of every La Mer product and today, we utilise the same processes perfected by Dr Huber many moons ago. A multi-step, carefully crafted system ensures that each jar of Crème de la Mer is packed with the same ingredients as the original Miracle Broth™.\n"

Founder, Lucy Goff, discovered the power of medical-grade supplement ingredients while recovering from serious illness, which sparked the idea for LYMA. The brand collaborated with industry experts and the world’s leading nutritional scientists, combining extensive R&D with the latest technological advances, to produce its evidence-based nutritional supplement. LYMA’s game-changing formula is the most scientifically validated nutraceutical ever produced, clinically proven to actively tackle inflammation - the root cause of ageing and disease. In 2020, LYMA created yet another industry first with the launch of its ground-breaking Laser - the world’s most powerful at-home skin rejuvenation device and the only laser suitable for all skin tones – a first for inclusive beauty. Using cold near infra-red 500mW laser technology, the LYMA Laser uniquely transforms skin from the base layer up, addressing more skin conditions than any other device on the market, including wrinkles, pigmentation and rosacea.\n"

This hardwearing, coarse fabric was handwoven across Donegal by part-time fishermen and farmers as the perfect fabric for dissipating the damp and cold weather, so often found in North-west Ireland, a far cry from the luxurious cloths being produced today. \nTheir weaving mill in Donegal Town, on the banks of the River Eske, is still the beating heart of everything they do at Magee 1866 and they are proud to support a tradition of weaving and manufacturing textiles in the northwest of Ireland, bringing a contemporary edge to an age-old craft. \nTheir location in County Donegal offers endless and ever-changing inspiration for their in-house design team. From the rugged coastline to peaty bogs, to open skies and rolling hills, the Irish landscape offers a deep well of colour and pattern to draw from. They are always looking for ways to envelop our heritage in new and exciting ways through contemporary design. \nNatural fibres like wool, cashmere, flax and alpaca are central to their collections. These natural fibres are renewable and biodegradable, coming from all-natural sources for a rich, soft feeling that can’t be imitated. Their design philosophy has always promoted the concept of 'slow fashion' through timeless collections, where pieces are designed to be worn time and time again. Sustainable fabric and high-quality, long-lasting products define their DNA\n"

    "description": "ME+EM was founded by Clare Hornby in 2009 to offer designer quality at lower prices. Frustrated by how hard it was to find flattering, on-trend and beautifully-made clothes, Clare made the decision to offer women a solution to this sartorial problem. Employing her extensive consumer insight from 15 years in the advertising industry, along with a lifetime’s love of fashion and an obsession with fit, Clare launched ME+EM. We insist on clothes that really do it all. We believe that fashion only works if you can wear a piece time and again, and feel completely confident in it. That’s why we rigorously edit trends for wearability and versatility. Meticulously design cuts and select fabrics to create clothes that make style look easy. Clothes that you can wear in different combinations, like fashion Lego. These are pieces guaranteed to last more than one season, taking you from the office to evenings out; relaxed weekends at home to travels abroad. That’s Intelligent Style, that’s ME+EM. We insist that everything we make is flattering, on-trend and functional. “Where the style set buy their basics” – The Times “The insider label and word-of-mouth website to build a wardrobe that will go the distance” - Vogue “ME+EM Triple Stripe Man Pants have garnered compliments at everywhere from Paris couture shows to Mayfair dinners.” – Anna Murphy, The Times\n"

But they needed to design them from the bottom up, defining every stitch to ensure they were just right.\nThis lead to the formation of the Moshulu brand, and in 1997 the first Moshulu footwear designed in Devon was produced.\nToday, Moshulu is one of the UK’s leading footwear retailers, having become a brand known and loved by its customers for quality, colour and comfort all designed to make you smile!\n"

Riley was inspired by the perfect balance exhibited by chickens in his yard. His first product, a flexible arch support, was designed with three points of support in the shape of a triangle. By mimicking a chicken’s clawed foot, these three points created greater balance and comfort. With this invention, a new company, New Balance Arch, was born. New Balance designers and engineers take inspiration from almost everywhere – from nature, to elite athletes, to simple everyday objects and activities. What hasn’t changed is our focus on improving performance. New Balance innovation continues to be about changing the footprint of running.\n"

We believe that you shouldn’t have to sacrifice comfort for style (or vice versa), so all Oliver Sweeney shoes are designed around our Anatomical Last. It’s a rather clever tool created by Oliver Sweeney’s founder after years of research that mimics not only the shape of the foot but also its movement, and provides a superlative shoe fit that keeps our customers coming back for more.\nToday, Oliver Sweeney is under the charge of Cobbler-in-Chief, Tim Cooper. A fourth generation shoe maker, he’s a great believer in the importance of traditional craftsmanship, but also knows that great design is about looking forwards, not back.\nOur factory in the Italian Marche region embodies this process: run for generations by a family of shoemakers, our contemporary British designs are handcrafted with a dash of Mediterranean flair, softening the stiff upper lip of traditional manufacturing without compromising on quality.\nWe take inspiration from around the world and filter it through a British lens, working together with designers, craftsmen, factories, in-house staff and customers to create an original range of men’s shoes, outerwear and accessories that reflect our customers’ individuality, flair and success.\nWe know that you can tell pretty much everything you need to know about someone from their shoes, and our customers tell us that ours send the right message, and support them in doing their jobs with authority, integrity, ingenuity and passion.\nAs the company has matured (like a fine wine, some might say), our range of top quality products has gradually evolved, and we’re proud to always be creating an unconventional statement.\nStep Up with Oliver Sweeney.\n"

Rather than settling for the second best, Michal decided to design the perfect mattress and OTTY was born.\nMattress DetailsThe OTTY Blue mattress has 5 layers in total, including 2000 pocket springs, memory foam and a layer of Cool Blue Gel, which regulates body temperature at night. This mixture combines the best of both worlds, soft sinking and body contouring of memory foam and the bodyweight support and limiting motion transfer of the pocket springs. Our mattress is also built with supported sides so you can sleep as close to the edge as you like, without having to fight to stay on.\n"

Their first reinvented essential, Harmless Poop Bag, unlike any other dog waste bag, is made of extraordinarily dissolvable, non-toxic, and microplastic free material. Harmless Poop Bag can rapidly disintegrate in landfill and the open environment, including our rivers, posing no threat to marine life and wildlife. Project Harmless has created a new category of dog waste bag. For the cost of a weekly coffee, it mitigates, in a small way, for the 10 billion \"degradable\", \"biodegradable\", and \"compostable\" dog waste bags that will be used in the UK alone in 2022, contributing to a growing eco-disaster. \nHarmless Poop Bag was awarded Highly Commended at the Marie Claire Sustainability Awards 2022. \nProject Harmless has been shortlisted for Startup of the Year at the British Business Awards 2022. \nCombining passion for the planet with innovative design, Project Harmless invites all environmentally conscious individuals to discover the latest inspirations today.\n"

    "description": "Shiseido has always been about doing things a little differently. When Arinobu Fukuhara threw open the doors and welcomed the first customers into his Ginza district pharmacy, it signaled the beginning of a company that would change the beauty landscape. It was 1872, and the Shiseido founder had just introduced Japan to its first Western-style pharmacy.\nAged just 23 and working as Chief Pharmacist in the Japanese navy, Arinobu was disillusioned with the medicine available. He teamed up with some of his colleagues and set out to find an alternative—more Westernized—way of thinking about health. Their inspiration was a noble one: “To take everything and anything good in this world and use it to create new things.”\nMore than 140 years later, Shiseido continues to thoughtfully fuse Eastern and Western philosophies and innovations together to serve as a beacon of beauty inspiration—especially the Japanese sense of spiritual beauty—for women all over the globe.\nWe believe that beauty can be found everywhere, in everything and in every person, and we know that meaningful beauty is so much more than just what we can see. Beauty is a shared feeling; it is diverse, and it is unifying. When we feel beautiful and confident, we can’t help but feel inspired to go out into the world and make a positive difference to other people’s lives. By inspiring empathy, beauty is the ultimate force for goodness. And true beauty is made with soul.\n"

Many of these suppliers only offer one fish, their speciality. \nWe specialise in delivering to private customers, in their own homes, this is 100% of our business and our specialism. We love our customers and they love us - weтАЩve been awarded over 4000 5 star company reviews and have an average rating of 4.7/5. \nWhy weтАЩre different:тАв WeтАЩre 100% committed to frozen: We believe that unless youтАЩre buying fresh fish at the port to eat today or tomorrow, frozen is ultimately superior - as long as the fish being frozen is of the highest quality.тАв Range: We believe we have the largest range of seafood to buy in one place online. You can buy black cod from Canada, scallops from Scotland and King crab from Russia in one order.тАв Quality: Of course, we are also committed to quality. If our fish did not exceed the quality available in supermarkets, we wouldnтАЩt have a business. Quality is not just a matter of freshness. ItтАЩs also about cut and trim. We will sell you a whole fillet if thatтАЩs what you want, but most of our customers are looking for the prime piece of the fillet - what we call a fillet steak. They donтАЩt want a Dover sole thatтАЩs too small to satisfy. They donтАЩt want inferior grades of crab meat - they want claw meat. Over nearly 25 years we have discerned exactly what our very discerning customers want and that is what we give them.\n"

    "description": "Volcano Coffee Works was founded by Kurt Stewart in 2010. Inspired by over 20 years roasting experience in New Zealand, he began Volcano as an adventure introducing the British public to the infinite variety of taste within the world of coffee. Today we are the combination of over 30 people’s shared passion for producing outstanding coffee and utilising coffee as a means of re-organising fairer opportunity whether it's to the supplier, customer or staff. \nEthically tradedWe believe in environmentally sustainable and ethically traded coffee, and work with partners all over the world who actively engage community-based improvements. Our ethical trading principles ensure that our successes benefit the entire supply chain and beyond, from direct initiatives at origin to local communities here in the UK.\nHigh quality coffee roasted fresh in LondonWe source only the highest quality specialty arabica beans from around the globe and roast them in small batches here in Brixton London. Our expert staff hand-roast on Loring Smart Roasters which not only ensure the highest level of technical precision but create up to 80% less emissions than other commercial coffee roasters.\nServed in the best cafes & restaurantsWe proudly supply coffee to some of the best cafes and restaurants in the country; from premier on-trade institutions such as The River Cafe and Claridge's to the best independent cafes across the UK. Our coffee range delivers this premium on-trade experience via formats that circumvent the need for professional expertise and can be enjoyed in the home. This is really coffee made and drunk by the best experts in the UK.\nEveryone deserves a fair shotOpportunity in this world, and in particular the coffee industry, is too often afforded to the few and denied the many. We believe everyone deserves a fair shot, refusing to overlook the value in each individual and their ability to enact positive change. We source all of our coffees directly from producers at an average price of over 100% above the fair trade premium. In addition, we invest in sustainable outcomes either via positive impact initiatives in all of the communities where we operate or via our participation in global sustainability movements such as our certification as both B Corp and a Carbon Neutral business.\n"

That’s why we created Whirli - the UK’s revolutionary toy subscription service that gives you access to a huge toy library of over 1000 must-have toys from just £9.99/ month. How does it work? It’s simple - subscribe to Whirli, pick your toys, keep them for as long as they are being loved at home and when your kids are done playing, simply send them back and swap for something else (or keep them forever if your child has fallen in love with them!). Easy-peasy! Less clutter at home, less money spent on toys outgrown or neglected within weeks and a lot less going to landfill.\nTo get started, choose one of our 4 plans ranging from £9.99 to £29.99/ month. Each plan will give you a token allowance to spend on toys eg. with our standard £9.99 plan, you will get up to 80 tokens worth £80 meaning you can play with £80 worth of toys for just £9.99! Once you send your toys back, we'll credit your account with equivalent tokens, letting you swap for something else!  Play. Swap. Repeat - simple!\n"

It does not distinguish between styles, genders or eras; it brings them all together to create a unique product. This duality can be seen both in the brand management, where Thierry Gillier founder and CEO works hand in hand with Cecilia Bönström, Artistic Director, and in the choice of teams. Duality and equality are an integral part of the brand’s internal policy, allowing it to score 82/100 in the French gender equality index. Zadig & Voltaire strives to improve this result on a daily basis.\n"
